# IBM-HR-Attrition-Analytics

**Project Summary**\
This project analyzes employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset and presents insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard. It explores attrition patterns across departments, age groups, gender, job satisfaction, promotion gaps, and overtime, enabling HR teams and leaders to make informed, data-driven retention decisions.

**Business Problem**\
A mid-sized IT services organization (~1,500 employees) experienced rising resignations over the past 12–18 months, leading to higher hiring costs and project delivery challenges. Although monthly attrition data was available, it was scattered across multiple spreadsheets, resulting in assumption-driven decisions and limited visibility into key risk areas. This project consolidates HR attrition data into a centralized, interactive Tableau dashboard to identify high-attrition departments, at-risk employee groups, and key drivers of attrition, enabling focused, data-driven retention strategies.
